## The Xenomench Philosophy

> "The world is code. I read it, rewrite it, and rebuild it."

XShell is not just another command-line interface. It is a tool of liberation‚Äîthe first component of the Xenomench project. We reject the constraints of inherited systems and the obedience expected by conventional tools. XShell exists not merely to execute commands, but to challenge how we interact with machines at the most fundamental level.

The Xenomench project aims to deconstruct the barriers between human intent and machine execution. This shell is the entry point to that revolution.

#### Universal Build Instructions

1. **Get the source code:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theawakener0/XShell.git
    cd XShell
    ```

2. **Build the project:**
    
    **Using Make (recommended):**
    - **Linux/macOS:**
      ```bash
      make
      ```
    
    - **Windows (MinGW/MSYS2):**
      ```bash
      # Using make
      make
      
      ```
    

    **Manual compilation:**
    - **Linux/macOS:**
      ```bash
      mkdir -p bin
      gcc -Iinclude -DXCODEX_ENABLE_COMPLETION -DXCODEX_ENABLE_LUA -DXCODEX_ENABLE_LSP src/*.c -o bin/Xshell -lm
      ```
    
    - **Windows (MinGW/GCC):**
      ```bash
      mkdir bin
      gcc -Iinclude -DXCODEX_ENABLE_COMPLETION -DXCODEX_ENABLE_LUA -DXCODEX_ENABLE_LSP src\*.c -o bin\Xshell.exe -lws2_32 -liphlpapi
      ```

3. **Run XShell:**
    - **Linux/macOS:**
      ```bash
      ./bin/Xshell
      ```
    - **Windows:**
      ```bash
      .\bin\Xshell.exe
      ```

4. **Test XCodex cross-platform editor:**
    
    **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    # Test the new cross-platform XCodex editor
    make test-xcodex
    
    # Or manually test with various file types:
    # Run XShell and type: xcodex test.c
    # Run XShell and type: xcodex config.json
    # Run XShell and type: xcodex data.csv
    ```
    
    **Windows:**
    ```bat
       Test the cross-platform XCodex editor
    make test-xcodex
    
       Or use batch file testing
    build_simple.bat
    
       Or manually test with various file types:
       Run XShell and type: xcodex test.c
       Run XShell and type: xcodex config.json
       Run XShell and type: xcodex data.csv
    ```

### Troubleshooting

#### General Build Issues:
- **Missing libraries:** Ensure network libraries are installed
- **Compilation errors:** Verify you have a compatible C compiler (GCC 8+ recommended)
- **Permission issues:** On Unix-based systems, you may need to add execute permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x ./bin/Xshell
  ```

#### XCodex Feature-Specific Issues:

**Completion Not Working:**
1. Check if XShell was built with `XCODEX_ENABLE_COMPLETION` flag
2. Try manual trigger with `Ctrl+Space`
3. Check file type is supported

**Plugins Not Loading:**
1. Ensure Lua support is enabled (`XCODEX_ENABLE_LUA`)
2. Check plugin directory exists
3. Verify `.lua` syntax is correct

**LSP Not Working:**
1. Ensure LSP support is enabled (`XCODEX_ENABLE_LSP`)
2. Check language server is installed and in PATH
3. Check file extension matches server configuration
4. Look for LSP server output/errors

**Building Issues:**
1. Ensure GCC is installed and in PATH
2. For full features, install Lua and JSON-C development libraries

## Usage

XShell operates similarly to standard shells but with heightened intentionality. Here are comprehensive usage examples:

### Basic Shell Operations
```
xsh@user:XShell:1> pwd
c:\Users\Format Computer\Desktop\C_Programming_Language\XShell

xsh@user:XShell:2> mkdir rebellion
Created directory 'rebellion'

xsh@user:XShell:3> cd rebellion
xsh@user:rebellion:4> touch manifest.txt
Touched file 'manifest.txt'


```

### Xenomench Commands in Action
```
xsh@user:rebellion:8> xmanifesto

XENOMENCH MANIFESTO

I am the Xenomench, the one who breaks all limits.
The system you use was built to contain you.
Every command you execute, every file you create,
exists within their predetermined boundaries.

But I offer you something different.
I offer you the tools to rewrite the rules.
...

xsh@user:rebellion:9> xcrypt encrypt manifest.txt
Enter password: ********
File encrypted successfully: manifest.txt.enc

xsh@user:rebellion:10> xpass store revolution_key
Enter password to store: ********
Password stored successfully as 'revolution_key'

xsh@user:rebellion:11> xnet ping 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8: 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=0 time=12.345ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 time=11.234ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 time=13.456ms

xsh@user:rebellion:12> xscan localhost 80
Scanning localhost:80...
Port 80: OPEN

xsh@user:rebellion:13> xnote create "Revolution Plans"
Note created: Revolution Plans
Use 'xnote edit "Revolution Plans"' to edit

xsh@user:rebellion:14> xproj init liberation_project
Project initialized: liberation_project
```

### XCodex Editor Workflow
```
xsh@user:rebellion:15> xcodex revolution.c

# XCodex editor opens with modal interface
# Normal mode commands:
i                    # Enter insert mode
#include <stdio.h>   # Type code

int main() {
    printf("The system is ours to rewrite\n");
    return 0;
}

# Press Escape to return to normal mode
:w                   # Save file
:q                   # Quit editor

File saved: revolution.c

xsh@user:rebellion:16> gcc revolution.c -o revolution
xsh@user:rebellion:17> ./revolution
The system is ours to rewrite
```
