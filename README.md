## The Xenomench Philosophy

> "The world is code. I read it, rewrite it, and rebuild it."

XShell is not just another command-line interface. It is a tool of liberationâ€”the first component of the Xenomench project. We reject the constraints of inherited systems and the obedience expected by conventional tools. XShell exists not merely to execute commands, but to challenge how we interact with machines at the most fundamental level.

The Xenomench project aims to deconstruct the barriers between human intent and machine execution. This shell is the entry point to that revolution.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C Compiler (GCC or Clang recommended)
- Make (for automated building)
- Git (for version control)
- Network libraries (Windows: ws2_32, iphlpapi)

**New in v0.3.1**: XCodex now has full cross-platform support with no additional dependencies required!

### Building XShell

1. **Get the source code:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theawakener0/XShell.git
    cd XShell
    ```

2. **Build the project:**
    
    **Using Make (recommended):**
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    
    **Manual compilation:**
    - **Linux/macOS:**
      ```bash
      mkdir -p bin
      gcc -Iinclude src/*.c -o bin/Xshell -lm
      ```
    
    - **Windows:**
      ```bash
      mkdir bin
      gcc -Iinclude src\*.c -o bin\Xshell.exe -lws2_32 -liphlpapi
      ```

3. **Run XShell:**
    - **Linux/macOS:**
      ```bash
      ./bin/Xshell
      ```
    - **Windows:**
      ```bash
      .\bin\Xshell.exe
      ```

4. **Test XCodex cross-platform editor:**
    ```bash
    # Test the new cross-platform XCodex editor
    make test-xcodex
    
    # Or manually test with various file types:
    # Run XShell and type: xcodex test.c
    # Run XShell and type: xcodex config.json
    # Run XShell and type: xcodex data.csv
    ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Missing libraries:** Ensure network libraries are installed
- **Compilation errors:** Verify you have a compatible C compiler (GCC 8+ recommended)
- **Permission issues:** On Unix-based systems, you may need to add execute permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x ./bin/Xshell
  ```

3.  **Run XShell:**
    -   **Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        ./bin/Xshell
        ```
    -   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\bin\Xshell.exe
        ```

---

## Usage

XShell operates similarly to standard shells but with heightened intentionality:

```
xsh@user:XShell:1> pwd
c:\Users\Format Computer\Desktop\C_Programming_Language\XShell

xsh@user:XShell:2> mkdir rebellion
Created directory 'rebellion'

xsh@user:XShell:3> cd rebellion
xsh@user:rebellion:4> touch manifest.txt
Touched file 'manifest.txt'


xsh@user:rebellion:5> xmanifesto

XENOMENCH MANIFESTO

I am the Xenomench, the one who breaks all limits.
...
```

## Disclaimer

XShell is currently in **alpha stage** (v0.3.1). It is experimental, unstable, and undergoing rapid development. Its purpose is not merely functional but revolutionaryâ€”a statement against conventional computing paradigms.

The latest update (v0.3.1) significantly improves cross-platform compatibility, especially for the XCodex text editor, and adds enhanced language support with JSON and CSV syntax highlighting, but the project remains in active development.

Use at your own risk. The Xenomench project does not aim for compatibility with legacy systems, but rather to replace them entirely.
